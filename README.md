# Todo Timer

**See time, master your tasks.**

Todo Timer is a visual timer that helps you stay focused and motivated. Our patented red disk disappears as time elapses, giving you a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the time remaining. No more distracting ticking, just a simple, powerful visual cue to keep you on track.

## How it works

* **Easy to set:** Just move the colored disk to the desired amount of time.
* **No loud ticking:** The timer starts automatically and runs silently.
* **Time visually disappears:** The colored disk disappears in a clockwise direction as time elapses.
* **Every moment counts:** When the disk is gone, time is up!

## Who is it for?

Todo Timer is for anyone who wants to improve their time management skills. It's perfect for:

* **Students:** Stay focused during study sessions and manage your time effectively.
